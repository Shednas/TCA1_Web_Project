                                As a simple and modern website, there is plenty of room for improvement to the site with addition of various functionality and optimization. Such as:
                                <ol class="list_item_report">
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>
                                            Dark mode: 
                                        </strong> 
                                    The current website currently features only one color theme, which may not appeal to all users. For people who prefer the more modern look of dark mode. The website could consist of a dark or light mode toggle for the user to choose according to their preference, which won't effect their content viewing experience.
                                    </li>
            
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>
                                            Content Optimization: 
                                        </strong> 
                                        The site can definitely contain more information that are relevant to the site. Also the content could use more CSS for font sizes, weight and colors for improving engagement and readability.
                                    </li>
            
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>
                                            Interractive elements: 
                                        </strong> 
                                            The site can definitely benefit from addition of more interactive elements such as effects and animations without being overwhelming. It could also use buttons like "Read More" to expand on certain topics if the user wants more information.
                                    </li>   
                                </ol>

                        <p>This section will constist of a log of my webdevelopment process, coding process and debugging process.</p>
                        <div class="report_sub_section">
                            <h3 class="third_heading_report">i. Web development Process:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        At the starting phase of my website, i looked up various portfolio of other people to get a general understanding of what elements needs to be there for a proper portfolio website. Then i started to write down some of the ideas that i might use, from any of the websites.
                                    </p> 
            
                                    <p>
                                        Now it was time to start creating the website. So i designed wireframes for all 5 pages in <a href="https://app.diagrams.net" class="report_page_link">draw.io</a>. The wireframe were created to have a consistent design and general idea of where all the element will be kept in the website to be visually pleasing. Here are the wireframes i created:
                                    </p>
            
                                    <ol class="list_item_report">
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Main layout:</strong>This is the main layout for all of the pages where i used the grid layout. So that all the elements that i would create would stay where i had intended them to stay, regardless of the future things that i would add on.<img src="assets/wireframes/Model_page.png" alt="Wireframe_for_all_page" class="image_for_report">

                                        </ol>
                                        <p>I didn't want to overwhelm visitors on the home page, so I kept it simple and easy to navigate.</p>
                                        <p>On the Project page, I focused on minimal details, providing clear titles. Users can click on each project to access full descriptions and documentation on the GitHub repository.</p>
                                        <p>For the contact page i wanted to link all of my social media on one side, for people to get in contact with me easily. But if anyone wants to send direct message, then they can send it from the website itself. </p>
                                        <p>On the Video Demonstration page, instead of embedding videos with iframes (which are often blocked), I instead used a clickable thumbnail that direct users to MediaSpace Northampton for viewing.</p>
                                        <p>At first my idea was to use iframe to link and open up the report pdf. But after consultanting with my module teacher, chose not to do so. I wanted to make the site page to have a pdf document feel, so i created it to look more like a document file. </p>
                                        
                            <h3 class="third_heading_report">ii. Coding:</h3>
                                <p>The coding process was really time-consuming. As I had to learn new HTML and CSS concepts, like grid layout, which was tricky at first but really useful once I got the hang of it. For the contact page, I used multiple grid layouts, which was complicated at first but effective in the end. I also tried to use some animations, but few of them didn’t fit the website and used absolute positioning, so I removed it entirely as we were instructed not to use absolute positioning.</p>
            
                                <p>For the home page, I switched from grid to flex for better fitting elements. I used clear class names like <code>grid_container_main</code> for easy understanding and easier future modifications/changes. I also added comments to my CSS to keep it organized by creating sections with them. Initially, I had separate CSS files, but later I combined them into one to reduce redundancy and load time.</p>
            
                                <p>I also didn’t use grid-area because it was a bit complicated and I preferred grid-column and grid-row. Overall, coding wasn’t as hard as I thought, but it took alot of time to learn and implement everything properly.</p>
            
                            <h3 class="third_heading_report">iii. Debugging Process/Problem Solving:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Now it was time for debugging. There were alot of bugs to fix for my site. The first problem i had to deal was that all of my files for the site were cluttered in a single folder. So i created 2 folder within my website folder, where one would be serve for all the assets used for the website and another would consist of css and js file for the website. Then i had to go to my code and add locations for those files in my code.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another issuse that i had faced was with my navigation bar for my site. As it wasn't responsive and didn't have the hamburgur icon. I tried to use the checkbox to turn the menu on and off with the hamburgur icon. But it didn't work out. My thought was that because i had used the grid layout as my main layout, it wasn't able to turn on/off the menu for my navigation bar. So instead i had used javascript with a quick tutorial from online, and implemented it on my site. Then made the hamburgur icon work well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also used the W3C validator to find out some of the bugs and issues within my HTML. It was a bit easy to make my site responsive, as i just had to tweak out some of the code with media query and adjust it accordingly. To ensure the page only has vertical scrolling and responsiveness. I had to fix it by adjusting and adding some code.
                                    Overall, the debugging was a bit tough to do. But it was a necessary part to make my website functional and be tested out properly.

                                This was such a fun module. I got to learn various concepts and figure out how to implement them properly. Since it was an individual process, I did a lot of research and found clever solutions to my problems. This helped me understand how websites are made and gave me a new appreciation for the effort people put into creating them.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                The module leader was incredibly understanding and helpful. He taught us well, making the topics easy to understand. His feedback was very valuable for creating this website, especially when I faced challenges with certain elements.

                            <p>
                                This module also pushed me to think critically about solving problems and finding useful resources. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that improved my skills and knowledge.
