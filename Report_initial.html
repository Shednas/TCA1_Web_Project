                            At the starting phase of my website, i looked up various portfolio of other people to get a general understanding of what elements needs to be there for a proper portfolio website. I started to write down some ideas that i would find in some website, regardless of them being hard or easy. 
                        </p> 

                        <p>
                            Now it was time to start creating the website. So i designed wireframes for all 5 pages in <a href="">draw.io</a>. The wireframe were created to have a consistent design and general idea of where all the element to my website will be kept and to see if it looks design wise good or not. And here are the wireframes that were created for the development process.
